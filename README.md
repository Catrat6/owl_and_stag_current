  This is a website built for the company Owl and Stag, They are a production company based in North Philly and they specialize in advertising.  I was contracted to build this website based on a simple template they had already purchased ... It used jQuery and Bootstrap along with custom CSS to create a sleek modern look website.  They wanted me to heavily modify it as well as add and remove a bunch of stuff.  If you would like to see it live in progress as I work on it go <a href="https://www.owlandstag.online">Here</a>
